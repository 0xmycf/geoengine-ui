The UI is build around the _central map_ component, where spatio-temporal data is displayed. The _top_ component is the ribbon-like header It provides access to data, operators and other features grouped by functionality. The layer list on the left side overlays the map and contains all visible data layers (with legends). Layer specific information is provided by the _bottom_ component which currently features a data table and citations.

__The 'Start'-ribbon__ contains the most frequently used operations:
